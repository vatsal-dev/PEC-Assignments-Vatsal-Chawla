#Ques 1: Find average of three numbers by taking inputs from user
  
#Define variables to take inputs
a = int(input("What is the first number?"))
b = int(input("What is the second number?"))
c = int(input("What is the third number?"))
  
#Define variable to print average
average = (a+b+c)/3

#Print the formula for finding average
print ("Formula to calculate average = sum of the numbers/3")

#Print result
print ("Average of the three numbers is " + str(average))

#Output: 
#What is the first number?3
#What is the second number?3
#What is the third number?3
#Formula to calculate average = sum of the numbers/3
#Average of the three numbers is 3.0
